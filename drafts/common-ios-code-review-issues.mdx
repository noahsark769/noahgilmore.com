# Common iOS code review issues
- using tuples instead of structs as return values
- using two optionals instead of an enum
- using non-exhaustive switch statements
- Not making things private
- Not having tests
- Unnecessary optionals (in parameters and return values)
    - Symptom: having a function which accepts an optional and the first statement is a guard let return 
- Exposing too many internals (private vs internal), like subviews
- Vars instead of lets
- Not making classes final
- Inheriting a class from NSObject when it doesnâ€™t need to
- Not following Swift API Design Guidelines
- Not naming things according to what they are, like calling something a store when it's really an identifier
- not using exhaustive switches
- using different data types when you mean an enum, like -1, isinfinite, etc
