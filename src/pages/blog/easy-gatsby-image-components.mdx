I used to use [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) as a static site generator to build this blog using React. As part of this, I wanted a simple component to display a static image, something like this:

```jsx
<Image filename="myimage.png" />
```

Surprisingly, this is hard to do in Gatsby. The default Image component generated by Gatsby uses `StaticQuery`:

```jsx
import Img from "gatsby-image";

const Image = () => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query {
        placeholderImage: file(relativePath: { eq: "gatsby-astronaut.png" }) {
          childImageSharp {
            fluid(maxWidth: 300) {
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => <Img fluid={data.placeholderImage.childImageSharp.fluid} />}
  />
);
```

Simple enough - I figured I could make it customizable using props:

```jsx
const Image = props => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query {
        placeholderImage: file(relativePath: { eq: ${props.filename} }) {
          childImageSharp {
            fluid(maxWidth: 300) {
              ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => <Img fluid={data.placeholderImage.childImageSharp.fluid} />}
  />
);
```

Unfortunately this doesn't actually work - `StaticQuery` is called "Static" because it's compiled and doesn't support string interpolation in its template literal. If you try to do this, you'll see an error like this on build:

```nohighlight
Error: BabelPluginRemoveGraphQL: String interpolations are not allowed in graphql fragments. Included fragments should be referenced as `...MyModule_foo`.
```

This behavior is [documented](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query/) by Gatsby, and that documentation notes that the alternative is to use a page query. I didn't want to put a query on every page with images though, so I started investigating other options.

I came across [this post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-made-my-portfolio-website-blazing-fast-with-gatsby-82ccddc2f671) by someone who had been doing some fancier image querying with Gatsby - they had the foresight to _query all the images upfront_ by using the `allFile` query, and filter them down with props later. Based on that, I implemented the following component, which works great and includes all the fun functionality that [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) offers:

```jsx
import Img from "gatsby-image";

const Image = props => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query {
        images: allFile {
          edges {
            node {
              relativePath
              name
              childImageSharp {
                sizes(maxWidth: 600) {
                  ...GatsbyImageSharpSizes
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => {
      const image = data.images.edges.find(n => {
        return n.node.relativePath.includes(props.filename);
      });
      if (!image) {
        return null;
      }

      const imageSizes = image.node.childImageSharp.sizes;
      return <Img alt={props.alt} sizes={imageSizes} />;
    }}
  />
);
```

Hopefully that snippet helps if you're trying to do something similar. If it does, [let me know](https://twitter.com/noahsark769) ðŸ‘‹
