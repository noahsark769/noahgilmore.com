  When creating the site for [Fluency](https://getfluency.io), I figured now was as good a time as any to try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Like all static sites I build nowadays, the site runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but unfortunately the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/) on how to integrate Tailwind with Gatsby are quite complicated...

> Update (5/2/2020): Added another bonus section about how to implement dark mode with Tailwind.

> Update (12/17/2020): Added a note about the `purge` config in `tailwing.config.js`

When creating the site for [Fluency](https://getfluency.io), I figured now was as good a time as any to try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Like all static sites I build nowadays, the site runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but unfortunately the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/) on how to integrate Tailwind with Gatsby are quite complicated. As someone who isn't super familiar with the current state of web build systems, PostCSS, etc, it took me longer than I thought to figure out how to integrate it.

So, this is what I know as the minimal number of steps to start using Tailwind classes to style your CSS in a Gatsby site:

1. Install packages:
   ```
   npm install tailwindcss --save-dev
   npm install --save gatsby-plugin-postcss
   ```
2. Add plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`, so that Gatsby knows to load postcss (which loads Tailwind):
   ```js
   plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`],
   ```
3. Add the following to a new file at the root of the repo called `postcss.config.js` so that postcss knows to load Tailwind:
   ```js
   module.exports = () => ({
     plugins: [require("tailwindcss")]
   });
   ```
4. Create a new css file with the following content (the directives here apply Tailwind styles) - I called mine `global.css`:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
5. Add the following to `gatsby-browser.js`, so that Gatsby imports Tailwind on every page:
   ```js
   import "./src/global.css";
   ```

Voila, you should now be able to use Tailwind classes anywhere to style your site.

## Bonus: VSCode Autocompletion

If you happen to use the Tailwind CSS Itellisense plugin for VS Code, which will autocomplete Tailwind CSS classes, there's an [issue](https://github.com/bradlc/vscode-tailwindcss/issues/74) open indicating that a Tailwind config is required. In order to make this work, you'll need to run

```
npx tailwind init
```

## Bonus: Dark Mode

> Update (9/20/2023): Tailwind now supports dark mode out of the box! See [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) for info on how to use it - this section is now outdated.

~I loved [this article from Stefan Zweifel](https://stefanzweifel.io/posts/support-mojave-dark-mode-with-tailwind-css/) about how to support dark mode in Tailwind: if you've already got a config file from the last step (`tailwind init`), then you can copy this config to support dark mode out of the box:~

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: ["./src/**/*.jsx"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
    screens: {
      sm: "640px",
      md: "768px",
      lg: "1024px",
      xl: "1280px",
      "dark-mode": { raw: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" }
    }
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: []
};
```

~Then you can use `dark-mode` as a specifier for your Tailwind styles: `dark-mode:text-white` for example.~

~(Note: I've included the built-in screens for Tailwind here, since if you just put in the `dark-mode` specifier, other screens like `md` won't work. I'm not sure if there's a way to extend the default configuration rather than redefining it.)~

~(Also note: you'll need to include the `purge` configuration so your generated files aren't huge in accordance with the [Tailwind recommendation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production).)~
