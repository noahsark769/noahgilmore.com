Pop quiz: in a `UIButton`, how do you set a padding of 10pt between the image and the title?

I had to do this at work recently, and I was surprised at how hard it was to reason about. There are several posts talking about this topic (including [this one](https://medium.com/short-swift-stories/using-uiedgeinsets-to-layout-a-uibutton-44ba04dd085c) which uses edge insets to flip the title and image!), but the answer for my use case was pretty hard to find.

Adding image-title padding is possible, but takes some trickiness with `contentEdgeInsets`, `titleEdgeInsets`, and `imageEdgeInsets`.

# UIButton Insets

To understand why adding image-title padding is hard, we have to look at UIButton's various insets properties, which control how the UIButton is drawn (in different ways).

## contentEdgeInsets

`contentEdgeInsets` is probably the easiest insets property to reason about. The insets apply padding to the content of the button, and they're taken into account in the button's `instrinsicContentSize` (which was what I expected).

- Positive values expand the button away from its content
- Negative values contract the button towards its content

With negative `contentEdgeInsets`, it's possible to get the image and text to draw outside of the button's bounds.

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="content-top.gif"
    alt="contentEdgeInsets top"
    caption="Top"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="content-left.gif"
    alt="contentEdgeInsets left"
    caption="Left"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="content-bottom.gif"
    alt="contentEdgeInsets bottom"
    caption="Bottom"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="content-right.gif"
    alt="contentEdgeInsets right"
    caption="Right"
  />
</FlowGrid>

`contentEdgeInsets` is the closest thing available to "padding" within UIButton.

## imageEdgeInsets

`imageEdgeInsets` affects the drawing rect of the button's image, and does _not_ figure into the button's `intrinsicContentSize` (this is different than `contentEdgeInsets`, which contributes to the `intrinsicContentSize`).

- Positive values contract the drawing rect towards the image's center
- Negative values expand the drawing rect away from the image's center

Because `imageEdgeInsets` modifies the drawing rect, setting positive values can result in a squished image - with correct insets, you can actually flip the image! Negative values have the effect of translating the image, they expand the drawing rect back instead of contracting it.

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="image-top.gif"
    alt="imageEdgeInsets top"
    caption="Top"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="image-left.gif"
    alt="imageEdgeInsets left"
    caption="Left"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="image-bottom.gif"
    alt="imageEdgeInsets bottom"
    caption="Bottom"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="image-right.gif"
    alt="imageEdgeInsets right"
    caption="Right"
  />
</FlowGrid>

Interestingly, `UIButton` seems to have some issues with positive left and right edge insets - if you have an idea of why, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/noahsark769).

Also interestingly, negative values of equal magnitudes cancel each other out!

## titleEdgeInsets

`titleEdgeInsets` affects the drawing rect of the button's title, and like `imageEdgeInsets` does _not_ contribute to the button's `intrinsicContentSize`.

- Positive values contract the drawing rect towards the center of the title
- Negative values expand the drawing rect away from the center of the title

As the title's drawing rect compresses (i.e., as positive insets are added), letters get cut off with [ellipses](https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1125608257806979073). As with `imageEdgeInsets`, negative values translate the text without otherwise affecting the button's layout.

    alt="titleEdgeInsets top"

    filename="title-left.gif"
    alt="titleEdgeInsets left"
    caption="Left"
  />
  <CaptionedImage

    filename="title-bottom.gif"
    alt="titleEdgeInsets bottom"
    caption="Bottom"
  />
  <CaptionedImage
    max={300}
    filename="title-right.gif"
    alt="titleEdgeInsets right"
    caption="Right"
  />
</FlowGrid>

## Image-title padding

Though there's no built in way to put padding between the image and the title of a `UIButton`, we can fake it by using what we know about the various inset properties. Let's assume we want a button with 10pt padding around the content and 10pt padding between the image and the title. We'll:

1. Add 10pt to all edges of the `contentEdgeInsets`
2. Add 10pt to the left edge of the `titleEdgeInsets` to shift the button to the right
3. Add _negative_ 10pt to the _right_ edge of the `titleEdgeInsets` since we have to make sure the button doesn't get cut off by ellipsis - adding this negative padding preserves the text's original drawing rect
4. Add 10pt _more_ to the right edge of the `contentEdgeInsets` to account for the button being moved 10pt to the right

The final product ends up looking like this:

  filename="uibutton-wireframe.png"

  caption="Magic incantation"
/>

Once we know how to do this, we can extract it to a method:

```swift
extension UIButton {
    func setInsets(
        forContentPadding contentPadding: UIEdgeInsets,
        imageTitlePadding: CGFloat
    ) {
        self.contentEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(
            top: contentPadding.top,
            left: contentPadding.left,
            bottom: contentPadding.bottom,
            right: contentPadding.right + imageTitlePadding
        )
        self.titleEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(
            top: 0,
            left: imageTitlePadding,
            bottom: 0,
            right: -imageTitlePadding
        )
    }
}
```

### Right-to-left languages

In locales which write right-to-left, content and image insets have their right and left insets reversed, since the image is to the right of the text. In RTL environments, it's necessary to adjust the `setInsets` method as such:

```swift
self.contentEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(
    top: contentPadding.top,
    left: contentPadding.left + imageTitlePadding,
    bottom: contentPadding.bottom,
    right: contentPadding.left
)
self.titleEdgeInsets = UIEdgeInsets(
    top: 0,
    left: -imageTitlePadding,
    bottom: 0,
    right: imageTitlePadding
)
```

Unfortunately, `UIButton` [doesn't have support](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53987344/support-nsdirectionaledgeinsets-for-uibuttons-contenedgeinsets) for `NSDirectionalEdgeInsets` currently, so you have to query the `userInterfaceLayoutDirection` to figure out whether to use the right-to-left version.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this post helps some folks wrap their heads around a [weird](https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1123798154082758656) UIKit API. If you're looking for a truly customizable `UIButton`, don't forget that you can subclass `UIControl` directly and use your own layout entirely - I did this for [Trestle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trestle-the-new-sudoku/id1300230302?mt=8) and it worked well, even when I needed SVGs (!) inside the button.
